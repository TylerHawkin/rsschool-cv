## About Myself
Biology was my major in university.While studying, I became interested in bioinformatics. Statistical data processing is an integral part of this field, so I started learning Python, and later got acquainted with other areas.

I realized that I am very interested in the design of websites and what makes them "live", this fully describes the frontend.

Thanks to open resources on the Internet, I can freely study and improve my skills. As a result, I now have good basic knowledge in the of layout and the basics of JS.
My goal is to master web development so that I have the opportunity to work in pleasure.
Therefore, I believe that my perseverance and motivation for an interesting promising job will help me acquire the necessary skills to achieve the goal!
